I learned the hard way (perhaps not as hard as Dr. Graham) that even small changes to a data set can cascade into larger problems.
Particularly frightening was merging clusters of similar entries,
I was always worried I would screw up the data set or erase someone from history.
Understanding the potential of these tools, and finding where I was comfortable pushing the limits was enlightening to say the least. 
With a more extensive knowledge of the subject matter, I feel I could craft better data sets, and be more confident in how I whittled them down.
With regards to showing my work, I think festidiously documenting your process goes a long way to helping others understand your process.
Especially in ways that dont neccessarily show up in citations; Bias, Erasure, Privilege, Error, Assumption, Luck.
In other classes, just showing that you read something may be enough.
Perhaps an additional step would be to explain, or keep thorough notes of the entire process;
Search Terms/ Engines, Tools Used, Collaborative Discussion, Happenstance, Problems of Access
Each play a role in shaping how we do History,
and intedtifying them can help prevent some of the more pernicious aspects of Historical writing from taking hold.
